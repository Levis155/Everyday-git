    <h1>A Complete Guide To Git</h1>

    <h2>What Is Git?</h2>

    <p>
        To truly understand Git, we must first ask ourselves the most obvious question, <i>What is Git?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Git is simply a <strong>version control system</strong> designed to manage and track changes in source code
        during software development. It was invented by <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> in 2005 for Linux kernel
        development and it enabled collaboration, history tracking and efficient workflow management
    </p>

            target="_blank">Wikipedia Link.</a></figcaption>

    <p>
        Now, another question arises with this definition. <i>What on earth is a version control system?</i> To answer
        this in the simplest terms possible: A <strong>version control system</strong> is like a time machine for our
        files. It helps us:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Track changes</strong> to your work over time (like a supercharged "undo" button).
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>Save snapshots</strong> of your project at different stages (e.g., "version 1," "version 2," etc.).
        </li>

        <li><strong>Collaborate</strong> with others without overwriting each other's work.</li>
        <li><strong>Revert</strong> to an older version if you make a mistake.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Some <strong>version control system types</strong> alongside Git include:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Mercurial (Hg)</li>
        <li>Bazaar (bzr)</li>
        <li>Fossil</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now that we know what Git is, let's install and start using it!ðŸ˜€</p>


    <h2>Installing Git</h2>
    <p>Before installing Git, we must first confirm if it's already installed on our system or not. To do this, head
        over to the search bar and type in cmd and press Enter to open up Command Prompt.</p>
    <img src="Assets\images\Screenshot (77).png" alt="screenshot of cmd typed on searchbar" width="500px">
    <figcaption>Type cmd on windows searchbar</figcaption>

    <p>Once in the terminal, we'll run the command <i>git -v</i> to check if git is installed on our system.</p>

    <img src="Assets\images\git-v.png" alt="screenshot of command git -v" width="500px">
    <figcaption>check whether Git is installed</figcaption>

    <p>This command should return Git's version number if already installed. If not, no worries! We'll follow the three
        simple steps of downloading and installing it below! ðŸ˜€</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>First, <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank"> we'll click on this link</a> to head over
                to Git's download page. This page automatically detects the operating system we're on and will present
                us with a download button. We'll click on this download button to initiate the download!</p>
            <img src="Assets\images\download_button.png" alt="screenshot of download git button" width="500px">
            <figcaption>click on this download button</figcaption>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Once finally downloaded we'll locate Git in the folder we've downloaded it to and run it to begin
                installation.</p>
            <img src="Assets\images\locate git.png" alt="screenshot of Git's file location" width="500px">
            <figcaption>Locate Git and run it</figcaption>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>We'll Leave the default configurations as they are clicking on next until we see the install button.
                We'll click on install, wait for it to finish installing, and walla! Git is finally installed on our
                system and we can start using it! ðŸ˜€</p>
            <img src="Assets\images\install-button.png" alt="screenshot of install section in git installer"
                width="500px">
            <figcaption>click on istall</figcaption>

            <p><strong>You can run <i>git -v</i> to confirm Git is installed.</strong></p>
        </li>

    </ol>


    <h2>Configuring Git</h2>
    <p>Now comes the exciting part! We've installed Git and can now start using Git commands on our terminal.</p>
    <p>To start off, we need <strong>to tell Git who we are by presenting it with our username and email</strong>. To do
        this, we'll
        open cmd as demonstrated earlier and run the following two commands:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><i>git config --global user.name "Your Name"</i> to present our username.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><i>git config --global user.email "project.email@example.com"</i> to present our email.</p>
        </li>

        <img src="Assets\images\username-and-email.png" alt="screenshot of commands to configure username and email"
            width="500px">
        <figcaption>configure username and email</figcaption>
    </ul>

    <p>Next we'll need <strong>to confirm that git received our configured username and email</strong> using the
        following commands:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><i>git config user.name</i> to check the username</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><i>git config user.email</i> to check the email</p>
        </li>

        <img src="Assets\images\check-username-and-email.png" alt="screenshot of commands to chech username and email"
            width="500px">
        <figcaption>check configured username and email</figcaption>
    </ul>

    <p>And that's it! Git now knows who we are! ðŸ˜€</p>


    <h2>Initializing a Git repository</h2>
    <p>
        As we learned earlier, Git tracks changes in our files. Therefore, in simple terms <strong>a Git repository is
            just but
            a folder whose files and subfolders are being constantly tracked and monitored by Git for changes or
            updates.</strong>
        Git also stores the entire history of these changes allowing us to revert to previous stages of the changes
        history.
    </p>

    <p>Now you may be wondering <i>How do we get Git to monitor our files?</i> No worries! We'll walk through how to do
        that in the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>We are going to create a folder on our desktop and open it. Simply right click on your desktop select
                new, then select folder, and open it.</p>
            <img src="Assets\images\create-new-folder.png" alt="screenshot of creating a new folder" width="500px">
            <figcaption>create a new folder</figcaption>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>On the address bar we'll clear the address and type cmd then press Enter to open the directory in cmd.
            </p>
            <img src="Assets\images\open-directory-on-cmd.png" alt="screenshot opening directory in cmd" width="500px">
            <figcaption>open new folder directory in cmd</figcaption>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Once inside cmd we'll run <i>git init</i> command. This <strong>transforms New Folder to a Git
                    repository.</strong>
                Congratulations! Git is now tracking your New Folder for changes and updates! ðŸ˜€</p>
            <img src="Assets\images\git-init-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of git init command" width="500px">
            <figcaption>transform New Folder to a Git repository</figcaption>
        </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Commiting changes</h2>
        <p><strong>Commiting chages in Git is like saving a snapshot of your project.</strong> <i>So why commit?</i>
            Commiting a change
            will help us revert to that version anytime, we'll also pass a message explaining what the changes were as
            this also helps others see our progress and updates.</p>

        <p>To demonstrate this we're going to add 2 simple text documents to our New folder repository, and for each
            document, we'll pass a commit message that we added a text document following the steps below:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Open New Folder and inside it create a new text document. Simply right click, select new then Text
                    Document. Name this file <i>text-document1</i></p>
                <img src="Assets\images\create-txt-doc1.png" alt="screenshot of creating text document1" width="500px">
                <figcaption>create text-document1</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Now that we've made a change to our New Folder repository (added a text document), <strong>we'd like
                        to
                        visualize what change we actually made.</strong> To do this open New folder directory in cmd as
                    demonstrated
                    earlier and run the command<i> git status</i></p>
                <p>Git will tell us that the text document we just created is not tracked, hence we need to <strong>add
                        it to
                        the staging area and commit it.</strong></p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-status.png" alt="screenshot of running git status" width="500px">
                <figcaption>check for changes on repository</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Before commiting the change however, we need to add the change to the staging area. This saves the
                    change. To do this, run the command <i>git add .</i> This command <strong>adds all changes to the
                        staging area</strong>
                    .</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-add.png" alt="screenshot of running git add ." width="500px">
                <figcaption>add changes to staging area</figcaption>

                <p>And now on running <i>git status</i> again we see that <i>text-document1</i> has been added to the
                    staging area.</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-status2.png"
                    alt="screenshot of running git status command to check if changes have been added to the staging area"
                    width="500px">
                <figcaption>check if changes have been added to staging area</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Now finally, we can commit the change and pass the message that we <strong> added
                        text-document1</strong> using the following command: <i>git commit -m "added text-document1"</i>
                </p>
                <p>And that's it your first ever commit! ðŸ˜€</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-commit.png" alt="screenshot of running git commit command" width="500px">
                <figcaption>commit change</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>For practice, repeat steps 1 to 4 for <i>text-document2</i>.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Now you should have two commits. One for <i>text-document1</i> and the other for
                    <i>text-document2</i>.</p>
                <p>To <strong>view the commits,</strong> simply run the command <i>git log --all</i>, and Git shows you
                    all the commits
                    you've made.</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-log.png" alt="screenshot of running git log --all command" width="500px">
                <figcaption>view commits</figcaption>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            <strong>
                Congratulations! You're now almost an expert at Git! ðŸ˜€
            </strong>
        </p>


        <h2>Branches</h2>

        <p>The final fundamental concept you'll need to grasp in Git is <strong>Branches.</strong> </p>

        <h3>What is a branch?</h3>
        <p>A branch in Git is like a parallel workspace. It lets you experiment, add features, or fix bugs
            <strong>without changing the "main" version</strong> of your project. This main version is often referred to
            as the <strong>main or master branch</strong></p>
        <p>In a nutshell:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Branch = Copy:</strong> Start with the main code, then create your own copy to mess with.
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Work Safely:</strong> Break things here (it won't affect others until you're ready to merge.)
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong>Merge Later:</strong> When your changes work, glue them back to the main branch.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creating, viewing, switching, merging and deleting branches</h3>
        <p>To demonstrate how to do all this we'll create 2 new branches on the New Folder repository. We'll then add a
            text
            document file to each new branch and call it <i>feature.txt and feature2.txt</i>. Finally, we'll merge one
            of the new branches to our
            main branch and delete the other branch in the steps below:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>On the New Folder directory in cmd we'll run the command <i>git branch new-branch</i> to
                    <strong>create a
                        branch</strong> called <strong>new-branch</strong></p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-branch.png" alt="screenshot of running git branch branch name command"
                    width="500px">
                <figcaption>create a new branch</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>To <strong>view all brances present in our repository,</strong> we will simply run the command <i>git
                        branch</i> and Git shows us all branches present.</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-branch2.png" alt="screenshot of running git branch command" width="500px">
                <figcaption>view branches present</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>For practice create another branch and view it following steps 1 and 2. Call this branch
                    <i>new-branch2.</i></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Now we'll need to <strong>switch to the new branch</strong> <i>new-branch</i> and create
                    <i>feature.txt</i> inside this branch by running the command <i>git switch new-branch</i>, and then
                    heading over to New Folder and creating feature.txt</p>
                <p>Finally, add and commit these changes as discussed earlier.</p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-switch.png" alt="screenshot of running git switch branch name"
                    width="500px">
                <figcaption>switch branch</figcaption>

                <img src="Assets\images\create-feature.png" alt="screenshot of feature.txt created." width="500px">
                <figcaption>create feature.txt</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    For practice, switch to <i>new-branch2</i> and create <i>feature2.txt</i> in this branch.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Remember to add and commit the changes to new-branch2.</strong></p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p><strong>To merge <i>new-branch</i> to our main or master branch,</strong> we'll first switch back to
                    our master branch by running the command <i>git switch master</i> and then merge <i>new branch to
                        master</i> using the command <i>git merge new-branch</i></p>

                <img src="Assets\images\git-merge.png" alt="screenshot of using the git merge command" width="500px">
                <figcaption>merge new-branch to master</figcaption>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>And now finally we'll learn how to <strong>delete a branch,</strong> by deleting the
                    <i>new-branch2</i> we created earlier. To do this, simply run the command <i>git branch -D
                        new-branch2</i></p>
                <img src="Assets\images\git-D.png" alt="screenshot of using git -D command" width="500px">
                <figcaption>delete new-branch2</figcaption>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>And there you go! You can now consider yourself a pro at using Git. Proud of you! ðŸ˜€</strong></p>
